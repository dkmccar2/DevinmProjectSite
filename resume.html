            <h3>Note-Taking App</h3>
            <p>
              This note keeping app leverages the PERN stack (PostgreSQL,
              Express, React, Node.js) and is deployed on Vercel. The front-end,
              built with React, provides a dynamic and responsive user interface
              for managing notes. Express and Node.js power the back-end,
              handling API requests, routing, and business logic to ensure
              secure and efficient communication between the front-end and the
              database. PostgreSQL serves as the database, responsible for
              storing and managing all note data to enable persistent access to
              notes across sessions.

              Patient Advocate Health Management Mobile Application, Capstone
              Project
            </h3>
            <p>
              The Patient Advocate Health Management Mobile Application is
              designed to empower patients by connecting them with qualified
              patient advocates who can help navigate the complexities of the
              healthcare system. The app allows both patients and advocates to
              create detailed profiles, where advocates can showcase their
              expertise, pricing, and availability, making it easier for
              patients to find the right support for their needs. Patients can
              store their health information securely within the app, enabling
              advocates to provide tailored assistance based on individual
              health circumstances. With features such as secure messaging,
              appointment scheduling, and access to resources, the application
              fosters a collaborative environment where patients receive the
              guidance they need to make informed healthcare decisions.

            <h3>Rental Property Management Software, Class Project</h3>
            <p>
              Visual Basic Application for rental property management, which
              featured role-based access for different user types, including
              admin, staff, and business analysts. The system allowed for adding
              users with login credentials and supported the creation of
              property groups, which could be assigned to specific staff
              members. The application displayed properties by their property
              number, along with the current tenant balances. It also included a
              notification system for each property, highlighting important
              events such as upcoming lease renewal dates, rent due, and the
              accumulation of late fees for overdue payments. Additionally, the
              application provided functionality for generating reports on
              specific properties or groups of properties.
